
    I want you to read those summaries for each code file we have in the project and create a detailed, user-friendly, beginner-friendly README.md file for GitHub:
    Always create an 'Installation' steps for the project by default, just like:
        ```
        git clone <project-repository>
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    from each code summary files, put some code chunks to the README.md so that the people will have an idea what's going on in that project.
    I want you to empty some places for users to later fill in their contact information. Also the license of the project is MIT by default.
